# SFS-ColorUi
Edits the SFS UI to be colourful and imformative

# What is this
Its a nice little mod to let you customise the ui by making the indectors change color, you could even make it one color.
To those like me who struggle to get imformation from text and plain patterns this mod will help a lot, it makes the throttle, fuel bars heat bars and velocity arrow.

# Important
When there are multiple rockets the main one/only oone of the rocket will update the color, i will try to fix but this is due to the fact each rocket has its own throttle and the code gets the first one when you load in.

## Features
- **Throttle:** Changes color according to throttle percentage. <br>

- **Fuel:** Fuel bars change color to show remaining fuel.<br>
