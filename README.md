Edits the SFS UI to be colourful and imformative

# What is this
To those like me who struggle to get imformation from text and plain patterns this mod will help a lot, it makes the throttle, fuel bars heat bars and velocity arrow.

# Important
Currently this dosent save the or load the color from settings, i would love to add it but currently i dont know how i have never amde that, i could use a ingame menu but it would look bad and im sure you have enouigh windows ingame.
